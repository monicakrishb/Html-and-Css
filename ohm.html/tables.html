    <p>The error messages are usually helpful, but sometimes they are not so helpful; 
        with a bit of practice you can work out how to interpret these to fix your code. 
        Let's go through the error messages and see what they mean. 
        You'll see that each message comes with a line and column number to help you to locate the error easily.</p>
        <p>An event can be triggered by the user action e.g. clicking the mouse button or tapping keyboard, 
            or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an asynchronous task. It can also be triggered programmatically, 
            such as by calling the <code>HTMLElement.click()</code> method of an element, or by defining the event, 
            then sending it to a specified target using EventTarget.dispatchEvent().</p>
