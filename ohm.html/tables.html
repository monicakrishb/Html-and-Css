            <dd>The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.
        Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. 
        With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.</dd>
        <dt>Table</dt>
        <dd>A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). 
            A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, 
            for example a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.</dd>
